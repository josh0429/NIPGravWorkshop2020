## Mathematica notebooks on the 2020 NIP Gravity Workshop

The [NIP Gravity group](https://gravity-nip.github.io/) conducted a workshop series on 2020 Aug 10-14, 17-21. Two of the topics discussed were on gravitational waves and stellar structures. Here are a few Mathematica notebooks that I've made during that workshop. 

1. `StellarStructureExercises.nb` discusses the equation of stellar structure for a completely degenerate equation of state and does a sample calculation for the mass-radius relation of a model white dwarf. It also shows the famous **Chandrasekhar mass limit**.
2. `GWSample waveform(no_backreaction).nb` provides a sample gravitational waveform calculation in the low velocity limit **without taking backreaction into account**.
3. `GWSample trajectory.nb` provides a sample gravitational waveform calculation in the low velocity limit **taking backreaction into account**. The notebook also outputs an animation showing a binary orbit decaying due to the emission of gravitational waves.
