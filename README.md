## Mathematica notebooks on the 2020 NIP Gravity Workshop

The [NIP Gravity group](https://gravity-nip.github.io/) conducted a workshop series on 2020 Aug 10-14, 17-21. Two of the topics discussed were on gravitational waves and stellar structures. Here are a few Mathematica notebooks that I've made during that workshop.
